# Welcome to MRegTest Project  
> Efficient Replay-based Regression Testing forDistributed Reactive Systems in the Context ofModel-driven Development

As software evolves, regression testing techniques are typically used to ensure the new changes are not adversely affecting the existing features. Despite recent advances, regression testing for distributed systems remains challenging and extremely costly. Existing techniques often require running a failing system several time before detecting a regression. As a result, conventional approaches that use re-execution without considering the inherent non-determinism of distributed systems, and providing no (or low) control over execution are inadequate in many ways. In this paper, we present MRegTest, a replay-based regression testing framework in the context of model-driven development to facilitate deterministic replay of traces for detecting regressions while offering sufficient control for the purpose of testing over the execution of the changed system.

MRegTest provides a regression testing approach for distributed UML-RT modles developted via [Eclipse Papyrus for Real-time](https://eclipse.org/papyrus-rt/) (Papyrus-RT). Papyrus-RT is an Eclipse-based, open-source modelling development environment for UML-RT systems. Recently, an extension of Papyrus-RT has been developed that allows the development of distributed systems with [UML-RT](https://github.com/kjahed/papyrusrt-distribution)


A detailed description of the MRegTest can be found in our [MODELS 2021](https://github.com/MajidGitHubRepos/MRegTest/blob/main/MRegTest_technicalPaper.pdf) paper.


# Usage
Please note that we assume that [PapyrusRT-distribution](https://github.com/kjahed/papyrusrt-distribution) and [Eclipse Modeling Framework](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) are avaiable on your system.
## Step 1 (Run PapyrusRT-distribution and Import the Project):

1. Open a terminal and execute  ```/home/papyrus-rt-devtest-latest/Papyrus-RT/eclipse```. Ubuntu users can run the Eclipse from the launcher menu at the left side of the desktop.

2. The Eclipse launcher will be shown, use the default workspace (i.e., /home/workspace) and press the Launch.

3. You can import the project inside your workspase simply from the ```File``` menue in Eclipse and then select ```import...```, and finally ```Archive File```.

4. Once the MRegTest imported successfuly, you can see the source code of MDebugger and mxgraph projects. below is a brief description of these projects: 
    ```
    MDebugger   --> contains the transfromations' scripts that allows to instument the model.
    mxgraph    --> provides webUI for MReplayer and allows the user to controll the replay and inspect values at any given time.
    ```
## Step 2 (Run the Model Instrumention): 
The transformations scripts are called by other project to perfrom the required transformation, however it is possible to modify and execute this script in standalone mode. Execute the trasformation script inside the Eclipse IDE, follow the below instruction:

1. Open ```MDebugger/StateChartDebugInstrument/EOLScripts```, then righ click on the "UMLRTInstrumentv0.1.eol" and select Run as -> RunConfiguration
    ![alt text](https://github.com/moji1/MDebugger/blob/master/StateChartDebugInstrument/Screenshots/Step1.png)
    
2. Create a new configuration under EOL program and make sure the source is set to "UMLRTInstrumentv0.1.eol"
    ![alt text](https://github.com/moji1/MDebugger/blob/master/StateChartDebugInstrument/Screenshots/Step2.png)
    
3. Select a Models tab in the dialog and add two model
    ![alt text](https://github.com/moji1/MDebugger/blob/master/StateChartDebugInstrument/Screenshots/Step3.png)
    
4. The DebugginAgent model always should have the following configuraion
    ![alt text](https://github.com/moji1/MDebugger/blob/master/StateChartDebugInstrument/Screenshots/Step4.png)

5. Configure the UMLRTModel to the model that you want to be transformed for debugging
    ![alt text](https://github.com/moji1/MDebugger/blob/master/StateChartDebugInstrument/Screenshots/Step5.png)

6. Finally, press the run and see the result in the eclipse console and result model. Now the software is ready to receive traces from clients at TCP port 8001.

## Step 3 (Run the Webserver): 
1. Open ```mxgraph/java```, then righ click on the "build.xml" file and select Run as -> Ant Build
    ![alt text](https://github.com/MajidGitHubRepos/MReplayer/blob/master/src/main/resources/Screenshots/mxgraph1.png)

2. Make sure "grapheditor" is sent as an argument    
     ![alt text](https://github.com/MajidGitHubRepos/MReplayer/blob/master/src/main/resources/Screenshots/mxgraph2.png)
   
3. Open ```http://localhost:8080/javascript/examples/grapheditor/www/index.html``` in your browser to the web interface of MRegTest
    ![alt text](https://github.com/MajidGitHubRepos/MReplayer/blob/master/src/main/resources/Screenshots/mxgraph3.png)
4. The user can see informative messages regrading "Finding a regression" in MRegTest's WebUI
    ![alt text](https://github.com/MajidGitHubRepos/MRegTest/blob/main/src/main/resources/regressionFound.png)

## Step 4 (Run the Instrumented System):
1. Open the instrumented model in [PapyrusRT-distribution](https://github.com/kjahed/papyrusrt-distribution) and generate the code. 
    ![alt text](https://github.com/MajidGitHubRepos/MReplayer/blob/master/src/main/resources/Screenshots/code1.png)
2. Create a "build" directory in ```~/workspace/[ProjectName]/src/``` and run the following commands:
    ```
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    ```
3. Create a configuration file for distribution in json format (e.g., map.json)
(note: more information can be obtained in [PapyrusRT-distribution](https://github.com/kjahed/papyrusrt-distribution))
    ![alt text](https://github.com/MajidGitHubRepos/MReplayer/blob/master/src/main/resources/Screenshots/code2.png)

4. Run the distributed system:
    - Each capsule is assigned to a process
    - The top capsule calls the configuration file with ```-c```
     ```
     (e.g.,
    ./Debug__TopMain -i tcp://127.0.0.1:1111 -c map.json
    ./Debug__TopMain -i tcp://127.0.0.1:2222
    ./Debug__TopMain -i tcp://127.0.0.1:3333
    ./Debug__TopMain -i tcp://127.0.0.1:4444
    ./Debug__TopMain -i tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
     )
     ```
4. Run the MRegTest Control Panel:
    - Go to the source code of the project in ```MRegTest\src\main\java\ca\queensu\cs\testing```
    - Right click on ```MRegressinPanel.java``` and run it as java applcation.
    - Then, the following window with two tabs will pop up. 
    - The first tab ```mutants generator``` provides you with the functionality for generating mutants from a model
    ![alt text](https://github.com/MajidGitHubRepos/MRegTest/blob/main/src/main/resources/RegressionTesting.png)
    - The second tab ```RegressionTest``` allows you to perform regression testing on either multiple modified models or signel modified model
